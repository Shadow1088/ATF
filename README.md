# School project for automatical writing ATF texts at the atfonline.cz
This program is written in pure Python and uses library pyautogui.

This code is not to be misused. I wrote it just for my educational purposes. If anyone uses this to cheat, I am not the one to be blamed!

# Need to know
This program does not type other letters than from english alphabet. If other character occurs, write it manually.

The program slow down drastically, when theres a uppercase letter. Its not stuck, its just retarded.

Only way to slow down this program is to wait before typing the manual characters. 

# How it works
At the atfonline.cz theres a graphical keyboard under any text showing which key you should press, we use that to our advantage
and make a script that recognizes that colour change. For each key we set coordinates representing it and we are done!

# Pros and Cons
(+) idk man it works

(-) It doesnt feel smooth

(-) You have to set your own key coordinates, if you dont have your monitor 1920x1080px
